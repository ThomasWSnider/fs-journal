# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This has been a crazy week so far. I'm learning so much, I'm just worried I won't be able to keep a hold of any of it. I've really enjoyed this whole experience honestly. The instructors, the labs, the lectures, the reading. I'm having a great time. Coding is actually fun. It can be frustrating at times of course, but that feeling when everything finally works is just wonderful. I've been struggling to find a good nightly routine with the coursework, but I'm confident that I'll be able to settle into one eventually. 

It's neat to look at a website and think about what sort of styles the developer's applied to it. I feel like my biggest limit is not knowing all of the properties that I can use. I know I'll learn more and more as I keep at it. 

The last two labs this week were definitely more and more challenging. I'm looking forward to the checkpoint this weekend.
