# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git to keep track of the changes we have made to our code. It also lets teams of developers work together so that each one can work on and see all of the code for a project, and it is a tool to help them merge all of their changes together. It is also probably very helpful is something goes very wrong and we need to go to the last instance of the project.
02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > The terminal command "mkdir" stands for "make directory" and is used for making new directories (or files? Are they the same thing?) in which files can be kept and organized.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is a value that is used in CSS in order to determine which styles should be applied in case they conflict. An element selector has a value of 1, a class selector has a value of 10, an id selector has a value of 100. This can be used to make general changes to all sorts of a type of thing, but I will still be able to change individual styles by adding specificity.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > If I overused the `!important` feature, I could see myself constantly finding styles that aren't applying or applying when I don't want them too. As Mick pointed out on Tuesday, two styless that have the feature will just revert back to normal specificity when compared to each other, so I'd have to utilize normal specificity anyways. 
06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```
