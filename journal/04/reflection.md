### Reflection
  This week has been pretty frustrating actually. I really struggled to complete the lab work. I didn't actually fully complete a single one of them I don't think. I want to and I don't want anyone to think that I'm just doing the bare minimum. I haven't been able to get to any of the newer material from the lecture. I finally used the put method for the first time on Thursday and it was truthfully quite difficult. I can't remember any of the specific things I need to be doing in the async functions. I probably just need the practice I was supposed to be getting during the labs.

  Jake told me that the service JS shouldn't change too much, at least not for the next week, so I think I will get that practice in. I'd like to use this extra week to work on all of my unfinished lab work.

  Overall, I'm disappointed in my own performance this week and I want to and intend on doing better.
