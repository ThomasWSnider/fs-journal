# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


### Reflection
  This week has honestly seemed pretty low volume. I seems designed to be that way, having just come off of the introduction to MVC the week before. The back end stuff has mostly made sense as it as come up. The conversation we had on Wednesday about security and taking steps to ensure software is protected and data is safe I found very interesting. I enjoyed the topic.

  I did catch myself slipping into inaccurate thinking though. I was helped a lot by Mick telling me not to think of the find method as the Mongoose equivalent of the get method, because get, post, put, and delete are all just asking certain code to run.

  I got really frustrated with Auth0 on Thursday, because it seemed to suddenly break for no reason after I'd been using it for several days with no issues. Really, the environment set up has been the most difficult part of all of the work we have done this week for me. If I can just get everything to work right, though, Jeremy showed us how to be able to copy and paste an .env file, so that should help everything immensely.

  All in all, I've understood everything taught this week pretty well (watch me not actually understand any of it haha), and I've enjoyed learning it. Some difficulties with the environment set up, but I'm confident I can overcome that. I can't think of anything this week that I have really struggled to grasp, so that is good! Honestly, writing this now, I can't help but worry that I'm being very foolish in stating that I understand it all. I should almost certainly strive to be a bit more humble about it.

  I am very much looking forward to the capstone now, as it seems like the whole experience of full-stack development will be very exciting and enriching. Thank you for teaching me this well so far!!
