# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


### Reflection
I have had a pretty good week class wise. Working on the fullstack is a lot of fun. I'm further behind than I'd have liked to be, but I'm optimistic that I will get the turn around time, and all I have left is the comments functionality and the styling, so I should be able to get it done pretty fast. I got very distracted by the styling this week, which I know is a mistake. Form over function. I'll need to reign that instinct in more strictly now that we are working on projects that are so much larger.

I hope to work more on Tower over the weekend even once I have finished it. I'd really like to have a super polished application that I can show others once I am out of the course. Obviously, the capstone and final apply here too haha. 

Thank you for answering my questions and helping me when I'm stuck. I'm really blown away by how much I have learned in seven weeks!!!
