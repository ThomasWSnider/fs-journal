# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


## Reflection
> This week absolutely flew by. For some reason it felt like we had more lab time in MVC week when all of the lectures ran super late. Regardless, I do think that I understand what we have been going over, and I am excited to do the checkpoint. Sink or swim.

> That said, it has been a blast and I have enjoyed learning all that we did. I am frustrated though about my performance in the labs. Every day this week, I have gotten less done during the lab than I wanted to, and I have gotten less done that following night than I wanted. The form on gregslist was giving me trouble, and I can not remember what Jeremy told us to do about the modal error so I'm planning on getting some clarification on that on Friday.

> Thanks again for the engaging lectures and always being there to answer my (stupid and silly I am sure) questions!!
