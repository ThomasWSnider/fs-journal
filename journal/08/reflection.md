### Reflection

This week has felt pretty lax. Just planning the project. We finally started working on it this Thursday. There has been a lot of little hiccups along the way, but I think we are going to do pretty well. 

Group work always has its stresses, but I think we are more or less all on the same page, and won't have any creative problems.

I am excited to learn how to drag and drop files, as well as how to use sockets.

Planning a project has been a lot of fun actually, I've enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.

All in all, it has been a pretty good week. I want to thank you guys for all of your advice and for your help, it has really been vital. Thank you!!
