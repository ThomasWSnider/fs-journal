### Reflection

The beginning of this week was so scary, learning two brand new language, losing truthy and falsey, learning how to populate things myself instead of just trusting mongoose to do it. All of those things were really hard to grasp the first time I was exposed to them, but I actually feel, as the week has progressed, much more comfortable with all of it than I thought I ever would on Monday.

SQL seems really cool and it is awesome to know how to do the things that mongoose was doing myself. C sharp also seems pretty neat (I am still mourning truthy and falsey) and I'm starting to see the appeal and use of a strictly typed language. I have not double populated yet, but I am really excited to do so. I have really loved how much inheritance as been utilized in the lecture this week as well, once we started using it, I thought it was really neat, and I've enjoyed using it more and more.

Thank you for teaching us all of this knowledge, it is absolutely mind blowing to me when I look back at where I was ten weeks ago, and thank you for helping me and answering my questions and clearing up my confusions! All in all, it has been a pretty good week!!
