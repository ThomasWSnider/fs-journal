# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> Inheritiance is when a child object inherits all of the properties assigned to a parent object.

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> A singleton is when you only have one variable that calls a class whenever it is invoked. This exists so that there will only ever be one instance of that class

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> An observer watches an assigned property and then exectes a function whenever that property changes

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> I think the strategy design pattern corresponds to how we have different controllers and services depending on what is being interacted with. The BananasService only ever interacts with bananas for example.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> I don't really understand why this is called a factory design pattern, but I think it has to do with utilizing inheritance to make code more interchangeable. For example, a ticket would be extended into an eventGoer and a myEvent.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is when you test your code frequently to determine what to do next

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> Dod stands for definition of done. It tells the team when they are done.

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> As a manager, I want to be able to check my employees' progress on the project, so that I can monitor who may need help to complete the project on time.

As Robert, I want to be able to have real time updates on my pizza delivery, so that I am not waiting around in hunger, not knowing where my za's at.

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> The word ceremony invokes some cultiness from SCRUM. A Sprint backlog would be created during a sprint planning session right? Or is it not called that and I'm just insane?

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> I think that tasks are assigned during the Sprint Backlong as well, right? I am 75 percent sure that is correct. The other 25 percent leans toward the Daily Stand Up, but that doesn't seem right as I would be updating the team on the progress I've made on things that I was assigned, right?
