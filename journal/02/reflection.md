# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week has certainly been more challenging than last week. Javascript wasn't making very much sense when we started, and I still feel like I really don't understand most of what we've gone over. The more I've actually been able to put code down and practice, the better I've felt about all of this, but I'm still not 100% about everything we've gone over this week.

All of this said, I'm a little worried about the checkpoint, but I think I do have the knowledge and tools to get it done. The further we go, the larger and larger all of this appears to be, which makes a lot of sense, but it is a little terrifying.
